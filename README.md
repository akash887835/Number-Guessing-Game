This is my first Git Repository.


A simple and interactive Number Guessing Game
built using Java Swing (GUI)
The player must guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.
The GUI shows hints like "Too High", "Too Low", and displays the number of attempts taken.

Features-
1.Simple & clean Java Swing GUI
2.Random number generated every game
3.Displays hints(High / Low)
4.Tracks number of attempts
5.Reset & Play Again button
6.Validation for invalid input
7.Beginner-friendly project for Java learners

How the Game Works-
1. The system generates a random number(example:1-100).
2. User enters a guess in the input box
3.GUI displays hints;
  . Too High
  . Too Low
  . Correct!
4. Game shows the total number of attempts.
5. User can click Play Again to start a new game.
